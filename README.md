# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser
A visualiser for different types of sorting algorithms. In this project I've implemented three simple sorting algorithms that sort in ascending order.

You can access the project here: https://samuelsurgeon.github.io/sorting-visualiser/

## Why did I make this?
I recently began my journey to become a Front-end developer and after dabbling with some HTML & CSS here and there, I decided finally to take the plunge and make a proper JavaScript app.

The goal of the project was to help me understand the fundamentals of JavaScript and React, so I only used those pieces of tech and avoided using Redux or any other addons for the animations.

## The algorithms

Insertion sort, Bubble sort, and Selection sort - these are the three "simple" sorting algorithms I've chosen because their animations are obvious and easy to handle. Also, I'm not ready to tackle recursion just yet.

## Responsiveness

Please note: The app is desktop only! It should work for any desktop screen size, but will break with a screen-size less than 500px. Larger desktop displays are fine because the array-bars' height is generated from the height of the user's screen.

## Browsers

For best experience use Chrome.

## Credit
This project was inspired by and based off: https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer-Tutorial

In the tutorial he actually implements Merge Sort, which I haven't implemented here, however I did use Clement's website AlgoExpert.io for help with implementing the sorting algorithms. So definitely go check out AlgoExpert and also Clement's YouTube channel.
