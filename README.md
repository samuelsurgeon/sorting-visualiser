# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser
A visualiser for different types of sorting algorithms. In this project I've implemented three simple sorting algorithms that are sorted in ascending order.

## Why did I make this?

This project was based off: https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer-Tutorial. In the tutorial he actually implements Merge Sort, which I haven't implement here, however I used Clement's website AlgoExpert.io for help with implementing the sorting algorithms I have used. So definitely go check out AlgoExpert and also Clement's YouTube channel!:-)
