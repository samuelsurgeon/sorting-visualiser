# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser
A visualiser for different types of sorting algorithms. In this project I've implemented three simple sorting algorithms that are sorted in ascending order.

## Why did I make this?
I've recently embarked on a journey to become a Front-end developer and after dabbling with some HTML & CSS here and there, I decided finally to take the plunge and make a fully fledged JavaScript app! My first proper web project!

I wanted to focus on enhancing my JavaScript and React skills so its built in React and JS only. I didn't use REDUX or any other addons for the animations.

Since it is my first project please let me know about any blaringly obvious anti-patterns or mistakes that I can fix up. I struggled quite a bit with figuring out where the logic for the animations should go, and need to read up on React Design Patterns more. I've used setTimeouts for the animations but might switch them out for requestAnimationFrame to make the code cleaner.

## The algorithms

Insertion sort, Bubble sort, and Selection sort. They're three of the "simple" sorting algorithms that I've chosen because they're animations are a little more obvious and easier to animate. Also, I'm not ready to tackle a project with recursion just yet lol. 

## Responsiveness

Please note: The app is desktop only! The app should work for any desktop screen size. The array-bars that are generated to be sorted are generated off the size of the user's screen. The app will break with a screen-size of less than 500px.

## Browsers

Noticed some weird behaviour in Firefox, for best experience use Chrome or Safari!

## Credit
This project was based off: https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer-Tutorial. In the tutorial he actually implements Merge Sort, which I haven't implement here, however I used Clement's website AlgoExpert.io for help with implementing the sorting algorithms I have used. So definitely go check out AlgoExpert and also Clement's YouTube channel!:-)
